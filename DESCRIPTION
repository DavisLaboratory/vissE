Description: This package enables the interpretation and analysis of results from a gene set enrichment analysis using network-based and text-mining approaches. Most enrichment analyses result in large lists of significant gene sets that are difficult to interpret. Tools in this package help build a similarity-based network of significant gene sets from a gene set enrichment analysis that can then be investigated for their biological function using text-mining approaches.
